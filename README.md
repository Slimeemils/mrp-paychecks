# mrp-paychecks
Paycheck system for QBCore

****You will need to remove PaycheckLoop() from qb-core > server > player.lua it is located at the very bottom of the script.****

This resource makes it so that players have to pick up their paychecks from Life Invader rather than it being deposited straight into their accounts.
Enjoy!

Currently set to receive a paycheck every 15 minutes.
